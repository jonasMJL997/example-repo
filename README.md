This repository was created to practice using Git and GitHub. It contains two files:

example_repo.py
This is a Python file that I created on my local computer. It contains basic Python code (e.g., printing a message). After creating it locally, I used Git to track the file and pushed it to this remote repository on GitHub.

example-repo.txt
This is a text file that contains the URL to this GitHub repository. I created it to document the link to the remote repo as part of the exercise.

Created a Python file (example_repo.py) on my local machine

Pushed the code from my local machine to the remote repository using Git

Added a text file (example-repo.txt) that contains the URL of the repository
